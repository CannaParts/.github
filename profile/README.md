## What is (to expect from) CannaParts?

- ***At least one guy, really sorry and sad to can't set a serious focus on this project before ~ January ~~June~~ 2023.***

- **Free and full access to the core and sources of doing cannabis as an illegal hobby for some decades:**
    - [Resource-saving knowledge](https://github.com/CannaParts/LetsGrowSmart). The probably most effective, but also most unknown hack is already: [here](https://github.com/CannaParts/LetsGrowSmart/blob/main/FastVegaFlowerLowPower.md).
    - DIY- and RPI/Arduino/ESP32 - friendly hardware from simple switches to real professional management of all climate and water parameters.
    - PLC Software with a strong focus on a grow-specific, powerful and easy to setup command-set.
    - HMI Software with the same focus on grow-specific needs and easy to use.


- **Same access on all what's 100% mine from the seven years I did the following jobs in legal Cannabusiness:**
    - Hot-runner compatible hemp-fiber.
    - Terpene and CBD extraction.
    - Medical Cannabis.

- ***CannaParts*** might also become a brand and company for solid standard solutions and unique consulting qualities.  
*(I own the most important CannaParts.xyz domains since a long time)*
